## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile** - < 768px (optimized touch interactions)
- **Tablet** - 768px - 1024px (hybrid touch and mouse support)
- **Desktop** - > 1024px (enhanced mouse interactions)

## 🔥 Key Implementation Highlights

### Custom Spring Animation
```javascript
// Custom elastic easing without external libraries
const easeOutElastic = (t) => {
  if (t === 0) return 0;
  if (t === 1) return 1;
  return Math.pow(2, -10 * t) * Math.sin((t - 0.1) * 5 * Math.PI) + 1;
};
```

### Gesture Recognition
