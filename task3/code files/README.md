           Math.abs(eventDateTime.getTime() - existingDateTime.getTime()) < 60 * 60 * 1000;
  });
}, [date, time, existingEvents]);
```

### Recurring Event Generation
```javascript
// Intelligent monthly recurrence with edge case handling
case 'monthly': {
  const dayOfMonth = recurrence.dayOfMonth || currentDate.getDate();
  const daysInNextMonth = new Date(nextMonth.getFullYear(), nextMonth.getMonth() + 1, 0).getDate();
  const adjustedDay = Math.min(dayOfMonth, daysInNextMonth);
  currentDate = new Date(nextMonth.getFullYear(), nextMonth.getMonth(), adjustedDay);
  break;
